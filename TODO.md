# TO-DO:

1. Update to Astro v3
2. Sort out TypeScript / Prettier errors
3. Add pagination to records and artists pages
4. Add Prettier and ESLint
5. Add tests
6. Exclude drafts from API response
7. Remove "genre" field from "Records" collection API response
8. Add button in the CMS to automatically pull Record and Artist data from music API
9. Get auth working

# LOOK INTO:

1. had to `yarn install` locally to stop errors (... or maybe just had to restart VSCode?)
2. why do I have to use `sudo` before `yarn` commands?
3. Payload "Local API"
