# TO-DO:

1. Sort out TypeScript / Prettier errors
2. Add pagination to records and artists pages
3. Add Prettier pre-commit hook
4. Add ES/TS Lint?
5. Add tests
6. Exclude drafts from API response
7. Remove "genre" field from "Records" collection API response (o)
8. Add button in the CMS to automatically pull Record and Artist data from music API
9. Get auth working
10. Add "tracklist" + "about this track" functionality
11. Need unique slugs in case records/artists happen to have same name
12. Setup tailwind config properly (add all colors, font, etc.)
13. Add data and src/media back to .gitignore files
14. Add global site settings to CMS

# LOOK INTO:

1. had to `yarn install` locally to stop errors (... or maybe just had to restart VSCode?)
2. why do I have to use `sudo` before `yarn` commands?
   1. also have to delete `"credsStore": "desktop"` from ~/.docker/config.json
3. Payload "Local API"
4. Possible to seed DB with initial test/dev data?
